<h2><a name="FOREIGNERS_ENGLISH" id="FOREIGNERS_ENGLISH">FOREIGNERS' ENGLISH.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> all the tourist-towns abroad British visitors are
much looked for; and it is amusing to see the
mode in which inscriptions and advertisements
are drawn up in English, or what is supposed to
be English, for the sake of riveting the attention
of possible guests or customers belonging to the
'nation of shopkeepers.' Many tourists have taken
copies of these curiosities, which have afterwards
found their way into print in various forms.</p>

<p>Hotels are famous for these curiosities: the
variety of languages spoken by the visitors
supplying a reason for this. The 'Drei Mohren'
(Three Moors) hotel at Augsburg has the following
entry in the visitors' book: 'January 28th, 1815;
His Grace Arthur Wellesley, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.; great
honour arrived at the beginning of this year to
the three Moors; this illustrious warrior, whose
glorious atchievements, which, cradled in India,
have filled Europe with his renown, descended in
it.' At the 'Trois Allies' hotel, Salzburg, some
few years ago, mine host invited English visitors
by the following announcement: 'George Nelböck
begs leave to recommand his hotel to the Three
Allied, situated vis-a-vis of the birth-home of
Mozart, which offers all comforts to the meanest
charges.' The prepositions <i>at</i> and <i>to</i> are great
stumbling-blocks to such concocters of English
sentences and phrases; the pronouns <i>which</i> and
<i>who</i> not much less so. An hotel-keeper at Rastadt
bestowed great pains on an announcement which
with many others was exhibited in the entrance
passage or hall: 'The underwritten has the honor
of informing the public that he has made the
acquisition of the hotel to the Savage, well situated
in the middle of this city. He shall endeavor to
do all duties which gentlemen travellers can justly
expect; and invites them to please to convince
themselves of it by their kind lodgings at his
house'&mdash;signed 'Basil Singisem, before the tenant of
the hotel to the Stork in this city.' If the good
man had hit upon 'Savage Hotel' and 'Stork
Hotel' he would have been a little more intelligible.</p>

<p>The circular of an Italian host, printed in four
languages, discourses thus to English visitors concerning
the excellences of the hotel 'Torre di
Londra,' Verona: 'The old inn of London's Tower,
placed among the more agreeable situation of
Verona's course, belonging at Sir Theodosius
Trianoni, restor'd by the decorum most indulgent
to good things, of life's eases; which are favored
from every acts liable at inn same, with all object
that is concerned, conveniency of stage coaches,
proper horses, but good forages, and coach houses.
Do offers at innkeeper the constant hope, to be
honored from a great concourse, where politeness,
good genius of meats, round table, coffee-house,
hackney coach, men servant of place, swiftness of
service, and moderation of prices, shall arrive to
accomplish in Him all satisfaction, and at Sirs,
who will do the favor honoring him with a very
assur'd kindness.' No doubt 'Sir Theodosius'
took some pride in this composition.</p>

<p>The card of an old inn at Paris some years ago
contained the announcement, 'Salines baths at
every o'clock;' and of another, 'The wines shall
leave you nothing to hope for.' In an hotel at
Mount Sinai, on the fly-leaf of the visitors' book,
English travellers are informed that 'Here in too
were inscribed all whose in the rule of the year
come from different parts, different cities and
countries, pilgrims and travellers of any different
rank and religion or profession, for advice and
notice thereof to their posterity, and even also in
owr own of memory, acknowledging.'</p>

<p>On one of the slopes of Mount Etna, at a height
of more than nine thousand feet above the sea,
is a house built of lava, containing three small
rooms and a shed for mules. Up to that point
tourists and explorers can ascend on mules, but the
remainder of the climb must be made on foot.
Hence the desirability of having some building in
which mules and muleteers may sojourn for a
time, while their hirers or employers are wending
their laborious way up to the volcanic summit.
When an English force occupied Sicily in 1811,
the three brothers Gemmellaro, the most indefatigable
of explorers and describers of Etna, obtained
from the commanding officer the aid of some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">{562}</a></span>
the soldiers (probably sappers and miners) in
building the lava house above adverted to; giving
it, in compliment, the name <i>Casa degli Inglesi</i> or
'English House.' Provided with a few humble
pieces of furniture, it is placed at the service of
visitors, who must bring their own food and fuel
with them, and bedding if they wish to pass a
night there. The key is kept at a house at the
foot of the mountain, the residence (lately if not
even now) of a member of the Gemmellaro family;
it must be applied for when required, and returned
when done with, accompanied by a signed certificate
declaring that the liberal accommodation has
not been abused. Printed notices are hung on the
walls of the casa in various languages; one of
which, in English, informs English-speaking visitors
that 'In consequence of the damage suffered
in the house called English, set on the Etna, for
the reprehensible conduct of some persons there
recovered,' certain regulations are laid down. Visitors,
when applying for the key, must give name,
title, and country, and must at the same time 'tell
the guide's and muleteer's names, just to drive
away those who have been so rough to spoil the
movables and destroy the stables. It is not permitted
to any body to put mules into rooms
destined for the use of people, notwithstanding
the insufficiency of stables. It is forbidden likewise
to dirtes the walls with pencil or coal. M. Gemmellaro
will provide a blank book for those
learned people curious to write their observations.
A particular care must be taken for the movables
settled in the house.... Persons neglecting to
execute the above articles will be severely punished,
and are obliged to pay damage and expenses.' A
significant hint winds up the announcement: 'It is
likewise proper and just to reward M. Gemmellaro
for the expense of movables and for the advantages
travellers may get to examine the Volcan.'</p>

<p>As English travellers will go whithersoever
there is anything to be seen, hotel-keepers look
out for them near buried cities as well as near
volcanic mountains. The following was copied
by a tourist from a card for English visitors, prepared
by the host of an establishment at or near
the excavations of Pompeii: 'That hotel, open
since a very few days, is renowned for the cleanness
of the apartments and linen; for the exactness
of the service; and for the eccellence of the true
French cookery. Being situated at proximity of
that regeneration, it will be propitious to receive
families whatever, which will desire to reside
alternately in that town, to visit the monuments
new found, and to breathe thither the salubrity
of the air. That establishment will avoid to all
travellers, visitors of that sepult city, and to the
artists (willing draw the antiquities) a great discordance,
occasioned by the tardy and expensive
contour of the iron way. People will find equally
thither, a complete sortiment of stranger wines,
and of the kingdom, hot and cold baths, stables
and coach-houses, the whole with very moderate
price. Now, all the applications and endeavors
of the hoste will tend always to correspond to the
tastes and desires of their customers, which will
acquire without doubt to him, in that town, the
reputation whome he is ambitious.' The landlord's
meaning is pretty clear, in spite of his funny
English, save in relation to 'the tardy and expensive
contour of the iron way,' which however,
may have a vague reference to railways.</p>

<p>A refreshment house at Amsterdam sells
'upright English ginger-beer'&mdash;the Dutch word
for 'genuine,' <i>opregt</i>, having led to a muddling of
the English.</p>

<p>Shopkeepers will naturally be as desirous as
hotel-keepers to draw the attention of possible
customers who are more likely to read English
than any other language. A firm at Marseilles,
claiming a good repute for their preparation of the
liqueur called <i>Vermuth</i>, have labels on some of
their bottles to the following effect: 'The Wermouth
is a brightly bitter and perfumed with
additional and good vegetable white wine. This is
tonic, stimulant, febrifuge, and costive drinking;
mixed with water it is aperitive, refreshing, and
also a powerful preservative of fivers; those latter
are very usual in warmth countries, and of course
that liquor has just been particularly made up for
that occasion.' It is quite certain that M. Lapresté,
a restaurateur at Versailles, said exactly what he
did not mean in the following announcement; by
confounding the French <i>prévenir</i> with the English
<i>prevent</i>: 'To Rendezvous of Museum, Arms Place,
9, Lapresté Restorer, has the honor of preventing
the travellers that they will be helpt at his house,
or a head, or at choice.' The original may usefully
be given here, to shew how perplexed the host
must have been in his attempted translation: 'Au
Rendez-vous du Musée, Place d'Armes, 9, Lapresté,
Restaurant, a l'honneur de prévenir MM. les
voyageurs, qu'on est servi, chez lui, à la carte ou
par tête, au choix.' At Rouen an announcement
is remarkable for the odd way of expressing
'London Stout'&mdash;namely, 'Stoughtonlondon.' A
bath-keeper at Basle informs his English visitors
that 'In this new erected establishment, which the
Ouner recommends best to all foreigners, are to
have ordinary and artful baths, russia and sulphury
bagnios, pumpings, artful mineral waters, gauze
lemonads, fournished apartmens for patients.' A
French advertisement relating to a house to be let,
with immediate possession, takes this extraordinary
form: 'Castle to praise, presently.' Those who
know the twofold meaning of the verb <i>louer</i> in
French will see how this odd blunder arose. A
dentist at Honfleur 'renders himself to the habitations
of these wich honor him with their confidence
and executes all wich concarns his profession with
skill and vivacity.'</p>

<p>At Frankfort-on-the-Main, 'M. Reutlinger takes
leave to recommande his well-furnished magazin
of all kind of travelling-luggage and sadle-work.'
Affixed to a pillar outside the Théâtre
Français, some years ago, was a bill or placard:
'Hardy Cook, living to the Louvre on the
West Gate under the Vestibule, old emplacement
of late M. Kolliker. He will serve you with
list, and he has parlours and privates rooms,
receives Society, and has always some Shoueroute
and Disters of Cancall.' Inscrutable words these
last, certainly. At Havre, local regulations for the
convenience of visitors are printed in various
languages; English people are informed that
'One arrangement can make with the pilot for the
walking with roars.' 'Pilot' for 'guide' is not far
amiss; but 'roars' as an English equivalent for
'ramparts' (if that is meant) is odd enough; and if
not, the enigma is just as formidable. The much-used
French <i>on</i> evidently increased the difficulty
of the poor translator.</p>

<p>A Guide to Amsterdam was published in Holland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">{563}</a></span>
in English, some years ago; professing to be written,
edited, or translated by an Englishman. Its style
may be judged from the following specimen,
relating to the manners and customs of many of
the inhabitants on Sundays and holidays: 'They
go to walk outside the town gates; after this walk
they hasten to free public play gardens, where
wine, thea, &amp;c. is sold. Neither the mobility
remains idle at these entertainments. Every one
invites his damsel, and joyously they enter play
gardens of a little less brilliancy than the former.
There, at the crying sound of an instrument that
rents the ear, accompanied by the delightful
handle-organs and the rustic triangle, their devoirs
are paid to Terpsichore. Everywhere a similitude
of talents; the dancing outdoes not the music.'</p>

<p>A Dutch volume containing many views in the
Netherlands, with descriptions in three or four
languages, claims credit for 'the exactness as have
observed in conforming our draughts to the originals,'
which (a hope is expressed) 'cannot fail to
join us the general applause.' Of one village we
are told, 'That village was renouned by the abandon
of saulmons that were fiched there. That village
is situated in a territory that afford abandon of
fruits and corns.'</p>

<p>A small guide-book for English visitors to
Milan cathedral is prefaced by the statement that,
'In presenting to the learned and intelligent
publick this new and brief description of the
cathedral of Milan, i must apprise that i do not
mean to emulate with the works already existing
of infinite merit for the notions they contain, and
the perspicuity with which they are exposed.'</p>

<h3>PART I.</h3>


<h4>CHAPTER THE FOURTH.</h4>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Father</span>, where do you go away all day?' It was
Charlie who spoke, clambering on his father's knee.</p>

<p>'I drive the coach, boy.'</p>

<p>'Coach? An' what is that?'</p>

<p>'Goodsooth, boy, thou hast seen a coach?'</p>

<p>'Ay, father&mdash;the coach an' four horses that
runs to Grantham. You do not drive a thing like
<i>that</i>?'</p>

<p>'Ay. And why not?'</p>

<p>The boy blushed scarlet. 'Why, father, you are
Sir Vincent Fleming.'</p>

<p>'An' what o' that?'</p>

<p>'Then is it not against your pride to be a <i>coachman</i>?'</p>

<p>'Poor men must pocket pride, Master Charlie,
as thou must learn some day.'</p>

<p>'Well, father, I like it not. Are you <i>so</i> poor,
dear heart?'</p>

<p>'Ay, sweet heart, am I.'</p>

<p>'What makes ye so poor?'</p>

<p>'Ill luck, Master Charlie.'</p>

<p>'What in, is your ill luck, father?'</p>

<p>'In all things.'</p>

<p>'Dear heart alive, I'm sorry for ye! When I'm
a man, father, you shall go no more a-coaching; <i>I</i>
will work for you.'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay, my brave dear lad. I coach to win
ye bread. We're poorer than the world thinks.
But tell them not this, Master Charlie, or they
will dun me.'</p>

<p>'Then I'll dun <i>them</i>!' cried the boy fiercely. 'I
hate those bailiff fellows; if they come here, I'll
shoot 'em!'</p>

<p>'We'll fight 'em together, boy. See that <i>thou</i>
never hast the bailiffs at thy heels. Here is Deb,
<i>Lady</i> Deb by courtesy. Mistress, my rose, say
good-morning to me.'</p>

<p>But Deborah was already in her father's arms.</p>

<p>'Deb,' cries Charlie, 'father drives a coach!'
Then seeing Deborah's round eyes: 'Now don't
you clack, Deb; don't you go an' tell it to all the
world, else they will dun father.'</p>

<p>'O me!' Then Deborah's eyes flashed. 'That
they shall not&mdash;never again! But I tell you,
father; I will coach beside you, and try to
drive the four brave horses! I will not let
you work alone!' Deborah's arms were round
her father's neck; she showered kisses on his
face.</p>

<p>'Off with ye!' cried Charlie, somewhat fiercely.
'You know that if any one should coach with
father, I should&mdash;not a baby like to you.'</p>

<p>'Hush!' said Sir Vincent, laughing. 'Thou art
ever ready to fight. I have spoiled ye both sadly;
so Master Vicar tells me. But Deb, I cannot
have thee to help me, little one. Get Dame
Marjory to teach thee all the ins and outs
of household work, and to trick thyself out
bravely, so thou wilt be thy father's pride, my
rose of Enderby!'</p>

<p>But Deborah laid her head on her father's
breast, caressing him. 'Father, you love Charlie
best&mdash;Charlie is your darling.'</p>

<p>'Who told thee so, sweet heart?'</p>

<p>'My own heart.'</p>

<p>'<i>Dost</i> love me best, father?' asked Charlie;
he pushed his curly head up on to his father's
shoulder, and looked up with arch eyes into his
face.</p>

<p>Sir Vincent gazed at him. Ay, the father's rose
lay upon his heart, his 'Lady Deb,' his darling;
but that wilful rogue, that youthful inheritor of all
his own wild freaks and follies, that young ne'er-do-weel,
Charles Stuart Fleming, the plague of
Enderby, was his own soul, the idol of his darkened
life. Sir Vincent pushed him roughly away,
and laid his hand on Deborah's fair hair. 'Love
thee better? No; thou graceless rogue!' he said.
'I love thee both alike. Sweet Deb, thou art my
darling too. Now be off with you both; and see that
there is no more gipsying or ruffling it while I am
away; for Jordan Dinnage shall have orders, if you
disobey, to flog ye both with the rope's end; for
nought but that, I fear me, will curb the villainy of
either one. Good-bye, sweet hearts, an' see that
ye stir not beyond the gates.'</p>

<p>The gipsies had vanished from that part of the
country; not a trace of them was left; for they knew
Sir Vincent Fleming well, and fled betimes. But
Sir Vincent had not been gone three hours, when
the restless roving Charlie was scouring round the
park on his pony, and longing for some fresh
adventure and wider bounds. Deborah and little
Meg Dinnage were running after him, and urging
on the pony with many a whoop and yell, with
torn frocks and streaming hair.</p>

<p>'Deb,' cried the boy at last, pulling up, 'I am
sick o' this. I am goin' to ride to Clarges Wood,
to look for Will; I shall cut across yonder.'</p>

<p>'But you must not!' exclaimed Deborah; 'you
have promised father not to go beyond the gate.'</p>

<p>'I have never promised that,' said Charlie hotly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">{564}</a></span>
'father asked me no promise, an' I gave none. It
is nothing o' the sort.'</p>

<p>'Nathless it was a promise,' quoth little
Deborah stoutly, glancing from Charlie to Meg
Dinnage, and back in distress; 'for we said nought
when father said: "An' see you stir not beyond the
gates;" but I kissed him, an' I said: "I will not."'</p>

<p>'You did not say that, silly!'</p>

<p>'Nay, but to my own self I said it. Father has
trusted us; so Dame Marjory says.'</p>

<p>'I care not for Dame Marjory. I gave no
promise; nor am I afeard of a rope's end. If
Jordan Dinnage beat me black an' blue, I'll go!
But I'll not see Jordan till father comes home.
Father loves me too well to have me flogged when
he is by;' and with a laugh, Charlie turned his
pony's head; but Deborah sprang after and caught
the rein. 'Charlie, Charlie, stay!' she cried; 'father
has trusted you to stay!'</p>

<p>But Charlie was across the boundary and far
away; his laughter echoed back. Deborah flushed,
the tears almost started as she gazed after him,
but she kept them proudly back. Little Mistress
Dinnage went up to her playmate and took her
hand ('Mistress Dinnage,' as she was called for
her little upstart ways and proud independence)
and eyed Deborah curiously. 'Don't cry,' said she.</p>

<p>'<i>Cry!</i>' echoed Deborah scornfully; 'I'm not
cryin'.'</p>

<p>'He's a bad boy,' said Mistress Dinnage gravely,
with a nod of her head that way.</p>

<p>Deborah half rebelled at that, then: 'Charlie
has broken his word!' and she flushed again.
'God will never love Charlie. The evil one will
take Charlie to the bad place;' and the bright eyes
glistened, but again the tears were stifled back.</p>

<p>'Not if my dad beats him,' said Mistress Dinnage
consolingly; 'then he will be a good boy, and God
will love him again.'</p>

<p>Deborah shook her head. 'Ah, Charlie will only
be bad the more. He laughs at Master Vicar,
and cares for nought. But don't tell your father,
Meg, that Charlie's gone away; he will not be
good the more for that; God will not love him
better. Charlie must himself tell father, and that
will make it right. So see that you don't tell
Jordan, dear, for I am afraid to see my brave one
beat; I had rather have Jordan beat me than him;
it makes me <i>fear</i> to see Charlie beat.'</p>

<p>'An' me too,' said Mistress Dinnage, with infinite
relief. 'We will not tell on Charlie; Charlie would
call us "Sneak." Come an' play.'</p>

<p>And the two, putting aside their sorrows, cast
care to the winds and danced away.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER THE FIFTH.</h4>

<p>A year or two have passed and there was
joy in the bells of Enderby, and joy in the sun
and flowers. Winter and summer, storm and
sun, how sweetly the days fled by&mdash;the wild
sweet days of childhood. The streams; the dark
green woods; the blue and cloud-swept skies; the
clear lagoons; the carol of birds in the gay early
morning, from wood and field and holt; the father's
call beneath the window, and then the long, long
sun-bright day; the games; the 'make-believes;'
tracking the wild Indians in the forest, hunting
the chamois on the mountains&mdash;happy days, these!</p>

<p>Time passed on; Charlie was alternately sent
to a public school and to a private tutor; he
was expelled from the former, and ran away from
the latter. The tender, but proud and stubborn
heart was never reached; so the dogged will and
headstrong passions remained uncurbed and uncontrolled,
and Charlie Fleming too surely went
from bad to worse. Three distracted governesses
in succession gave up Lady Deb; their reigns
were short and eventful.</p>

<p>Upon a certain day stood Deborah Fleming,
watching for Charlie's coming. For a week
past Charlie had daily ridden over to the neighbouring
university town to 'read' with his cousin
Kingston Fleming, who had just entered there, and
being somewhat of the same stamp as himself,
imagine how much 'reading' was accomplished!
The lads came and went at all hours; sometimes
at Enderby, sometimes away. To-day they were
late. Deborah was weary. She wandered into
the garden, between the high sunny walls, and
threw herself on the warm grass amongst the
daisies; she plucked a daisy idly, and grew intent
over it, filliping away the leaves: 'He loves me, he
loves not me!' and so forth. While thus musing,
a tall fair youth, with a face browned by sun and
wind, stole behind her, his whole countenance
brimming over with merriment. Deborah instinctively
turned her head. All her heart's
blood rushed over her face, and her gray eyes
flamed and dilated like a stag at bay; for one
moment she glared at the youth, and then, before
he could speak, was up and away. A peal of
laughter followed her as she fled.</p>

<p>'Hi! what's the matter, King?' cried Charlie
Fleming, swaggering up in his riding-gear. 'What
is the cause of this immoderate laughter? Deb
has flamed by me like a whirlwind; I tried to
catch her.'</p>

<p>Still, for some moments, Kingston Fleming
shouted with uncontrollable mirth, rolling on the
grass. When he could speak, he said: 'You will
never guess, Charlie! Yet it is a shame to tell
you. And yet it is too rare a joke to keep! <i>Little
Deb hath got a lover!</i>' And with that, Kingston
went off again.</p>

<p>'I came up unawares,' said he, 'an' my Lady
Deb sat on the grass. "He loves me, he loves not
me!" she said; not like Deb proud and haughty,
but quite tender and subdued over it. She turned
and saw me. Egad! how she blushed, and what
a glare! Poor little Deb, she was distraught
for shame and anger. I was a brute to laugh!'</p>

<p>'I will roast her,' said Charlie. 'Deb a <i>lover</i>?
Ha, ha, ha!'</p>

<p>'No; you shall not speak of it,' said Kingston,
laying a heavy hand on Charlie's shoulder. 'On
peril of your life, you shall not.'</p>

<p>Charlie laughed. 'Under that threat I must
succumb. Perchance Deb has a sneaking liking
for you, old King!'</p>

<p>'For <i>me</i>?' And Kingston had a fresh fit of
laughter. 'Nay; Deb hates me like poison, and I
think her the maddest little fury that ever stepped.
Deb and I shall ne'er run together.'</p>

<p>But as for the maiden, she fled to her room like a
little tempest, and lay along the floor half dead for
shame. She could scarcely think, for when she
thought, the blood rushed in eddying torrents to
her head, and made her mad for anger and for
shame; for more than aught on earth, was Deb shy
of the dawn of love and Kingston's raillery. All
day she kept her room. She watched from behind
the curtains Kingston and Charlie ride away; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">{565}</a></span>
had not kissed Charlie that day or spoken to him;
she heard him call out 'Good-bye, Deb.' Then he
would not return that night. O Charlie, Charlie!
And then she peered out, and heard Kingston's
laugh, and saw his fair hair blown by the wind.
The girl leaned out and watched them through the
gateway. 'I love him,' she said to herself with
mingled fire and softness; 'I love Kingston. But
he will love <i>me</i> never&mdash;never!'</p>

<p>Kingston laughed no more about Deborah's
daisy: he was generous. The next day he was
teasing, laughing, tormenting about a hundred
things; and the child Deborah was chaffering and
defying him in the wildest animal spirits. Dame
Marjory shook her head; there was such a flying,
scurrying, shouting, and such peals of laughter,
not only from those three, but from the usually
demure Mistress Dinnage who joined them, that
the Dame could make nothing of them; they got
worse and worse. Kingston Fleming was a wild
youth, not one indeed calculated to steady his
kinsman Charlie. Yet Kingston had good, and
even noble impulses in those days: he was ambitious
too; and at odd hours and by fits and starts,
he worked hard, with the idea of fulfilling those
ambitious dreams. But Charlie never worked
at all; <i>his</i> dreams, if he had any, were not known.
Himself caring little for any man, who cared for
Charlie? Why, all who knew him loved him;
they could scarce tell why. Old Jordan Dinnage,
who had given him many a rough hiding, idolised
the boy; young Margaret Dinnage, who had
received many a rough word from him&mdash;well,
young 'Mistress Dinnage' did deign to open
the gates to Charlie Fleming's horse, though she
would do so with a toss of her head and an
assumed air of disdain. The maiden resented
even then, though still a child in years, the full-blown
compliments of the lad Kingston; but
would redden, and her dark eyes would glow,
when the boys passed by, if she only met the swift,
shamed, furtive glance from two full red-brown
eyes&mdash;the eyes of Charles Fleming.</p>


<p class='p2'>On sunny mornings, when the lads rode unexpectedly
into the courtyard of Enderby, there
would be a whir-r-r-r of pigeons, lighting on
the gabled roof; a blaze of sunshine on the
great wych-elms; a murmur of bees; a smell
of fruit and flowers; white-haired Sir Vincent
standing in a stable-door; over the garden wall,
Deborah and Margaret flying along the garden
walk with arms linked in the 'maddest merriest
dance,' set to the music of boisterous laughter.
Those were happy days.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h3>PART II.&mdash;NOON.</h3>


<h4>CHAPTER THE FIRST.</h4>

<p>'Hath he gone, Lady Deb? Hath Finton gone?'
It was Dame Marjory who spoke, treading cautiously
as she entered the young mistress's presence.</p>

<p>Deborah tossed her head, and gave a short laugh.
'Ay; he blustered, though. It is the third time
he has come to dun father. My dame, these
are hard times; but all may yet be well.
Look you, I have saved <i>so</i> much for father; if
Finton could see it, how his eyes would glitter
like a wolf's. I hate that man; I hate all money-hunters.
I care not if it be the law or not; it is
dirty work! Take you this gold, dame; hide it
well, lest I covet to buy a new gay scarf like
Mistress Dinnage's. Away with it! and let me
see the stuff no more.'</p>

<p>Dame Marjory took the gold, but she looked
back over her shoulder, and her old eyes gleamed:
'<i>Thou</i> to want for what Jordan's daughter has
for askin'!' she said. 'What right has Mistress
Dinnage to flaunt in silken scarfs&mdash;and <i>my</i> child,
my mistress, my lady "rose o' Enderby" to pine
and pine? My child'&mdash;and the old woman faced
Deborah, and the hot fierce tears welled into her
eyes&mdash;'I was wont to dress thee better than a
queen; now, look at thy dress! What right, what
call hath Sir Vincent Fleming's daughter to wear
such dress as thine? A gipsy hag would scorn
it! An' thy poor mother would have cursed the
day that saw thee in this strait.'</p>

<p>'Hush, Marjory&mdash;hush!'</p>

<p>'I will not hush! It is thy father's an' thy
brother's sin. I will not hush! O child, child,
my heart is harried for thee!' And the old woman
fell from her vehemence, and began to weep most
bitterly.</p>

<p>Deborah softened at that; she flew to her nurse's
side in wonderment, and kneeled at her feet in
tender trouble. 'Dame, dame!' she said, 'it is
not thy habit to give way to tears&mdash;and all for
me, for <i>me</i>, dear dame, who am not worthy to
have thee shed a tear! Hearken! Do you think
I care to flaunt in silks? Do you think indeed
Sir Vincent Fleming's daughter would wear fine
feathers while <i>he</i> owed a penny? You might
<i>then</i> weep for shame. But I am too proud for that.
Now kiss me; and do not weep, oldest, truest
friend. I cannot have thee weep!' Impossible
to describe the tenderness of tone in those last
words. Some thought Deborah Fleming cold,
hard, haughty; they would not have thought so
then.</p>

<p>Left alone, the girl resumed her gay debonair
air. She gazed at herself in one of the long
mirrors; she smiled and courtesied low, in
mockery; then drawing herself up, she gazed
again. Now Deborah would utter her thoughts
aloud; it was a way she had. Regarding herself,
she said: 'Nay; you are not fit; you cut a sorry
figure in the world. She says truly. Yet what
would you have me do? Beg borrowed plumes?
Use ill-gotten gains? Would Deborah Fleming
be the fairer for <i>that</i>? The fairer, perchance, but
not the nobler. Oh, you are a sorry bird, Deb!
The old barn-hen has a richer dress than <i>you</i>.'
Then again, jerking her head upward once, twice,
thrice: 'No wonder Kingston Fleming does not
love you. "Master Kingston Fleming!"' she added&mdash;and
her lip curled with superb scorn&mdash;'loves
fine dresses and silk shoes. He loves to see
"beauty go beautifully." <i>I</i> am not a "Mistress
May" or "Mistress Blancheflower."' With that,
Deborah shot off all her satire; and laughing,
tripped from the room.</p>

<p>In a few moments more she was running with
the fleet foot of her childhood across meadow and
holt, gay as a skylark. Presently she stopped, for
in her course, with her back to a tree, stood a tall
gipsy woman, with a red and yellow scarf upon
her head. 'What do you here?' asked Deborah
haughtily. The old scene in the camp came back;
the fugitive retreat at night; she and Charlie and
the old beldam huddled in a covered cart together;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">{566}</a></span>
and outside, the tramp, tramp of horses and of
men, and the mysterious jingle of pots and kettles,
and the angry blows received from the old beldam
for the noise she and Charlie made. The gipsy
too recognised Deborah: this was not the child,
though, who eyed her through the gate, but a
proud imperious lady. In spite of the plain rough
dress, the woman, with the nice discernment of a
peasant and a gipsy, knew the lady, and the Lady
of Enderby to boot. With unabashed impudence
the gipsy stepped forward: 'I was waitin' to see
ye, pretty lady.'</p>

<p>'And what do you want with me?' asked
Deborah. 'This place is not for such as you.
Honest poor folk may seek me here, and welcome;
not gipsy vagabonds and thieves. If you have a
petition, refer it to the back door and the cook,
not to Mistress Fleming.'</p>

<p>The woman turned aside her head; for the
moment her dark face was distorted by impotent
rage and passion; but when again turned on
Deborah, it was calm. She darted forward and
clasped her hands, for Deborah was passing on.</p>

<p>'I am no thief,' said the woman, with shortened
breath. 'I am an honest woman, lady, an' honester
than many folk that live in great housen, like
yonder. Pretty lady, don't be so hard on the poor
gipsy. I've had troubles I tell ye, to which
yours are nought&mdash;an' I don't ask yer pity.'</p>

<p>'Then what do you ask?' asked Deborah, turning
full upon her.</p>

<p>'Yer hand&mdash;to let me see yer hand.'</p>

<p>'For the sake of gold! I have no gold to give
you.'</p>

<p>'Nay, for no gold,' said the woman eagerly;
'but to read yer fate. A silver piece will do
it. There! I will tell ye yer fortune for that.'</p>

<p>'And to what end? Have <i>you</i> an interest in
me? in one whom you would have gladly lured
away to a life of sin and misery? or as a hostage
for my father's gold? You have done me grievous
wrong. You take too much heed by half to the
interests of the Flemings, woman; it is for no good.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said the gipsy, in a strange low tone, 'I
take interest in ye, but <i>more</i> in yours. Lady, let
me see yer hand. I tell ye I have interest in
yer fate, and in the fate o' one yer soul loves.
Come!'</p>

<p>'You shall not wheedle me into it,' said Deborah.
'If I consent to let you, it will be of mine own
free-will and after thought, not from words of
yours. Some tell me it is vain; some say that
fortune-telling sells you to the evil one&mdash;that it is
grievous sin to seek your fate by signs and stars.
<i>I</i> am not of these opinions.' The girl seemed
talking to herself; the gipsy watched her keenly.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Deborah, looking up and full at her,
'you shall tell my fortune. But can you trust me
for the money?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'And why?'</p>

<p>'Because ye can't tell a lie.'</p>

<p>'That is well. I believe in witchcraft; this is
why I hear you. Had you not come here, I would
sooner or later have sought you, because time is
slow, is slow, woman, and I want to know my
fate! I will not say God forgive me: it seems
almost mockery to ask forgiveness on what my
heart knows to be wrong.'</p>

<p>'<i>Wrong</i>, lady?'</p>

<p>'Yes, wrong!' cried the maid, striking her foot
on the ground. With that she held out her hand,
a pink palm and tender lines, for the witch-woman's
mystic reading. They both stood silent&mdash;the
gipsy gazing downwards; Deborah gazing
on the weird countenance before her, while the
rich blood spread and deepened on her own with
timidity and with shame. 'What do you see?'
asked Deborah at length, with curling lip. 'I
scarce believe you; it seems too vain!'</p>

<p>Then answered the gipsy woman, in low strange
tones: 'You will be a great lady yet&mdash;ay, greater
than Mistress Fleming. Ye will not go far to find
yer greatness, either&mdash;it will meet ye at yer own
gates; love and greatness will come hand in hand.'</p>

<p>Deborah's eyes sparkled. Then she said:
'Woman, that cannot be!' Then with the blood
mounting to her brow like flame: 'What did you
say&mdash;of one whom my soul loves? Who is he?'</p>

<p>'A fair tall youth. I know his title; but the
title, look ye, will never be yours.'</p>

<p>'Then I care for nought!' said Deborah Fleming,
and she flung away the gipsy's hand. 'Your craft
is wanting. It is a vain, lying, deceitful craft!
Look ye, Deborah Fleming will never be your
great man's wife! You lie! I love power and
riches; but I scorn them as <i>you</i> would foretell
them to me. Gipsy, I have had enough of your
fortunes and of you!'</p>

<p>She was gone&mdash;that proud young Mistress
Fleming, whose will had never been crossed or
curbed; tall beautiful young ash, that would yield
neither to breeze nor tempest, but held its head so
high.</p>

<p>The gipsy gazed after her; fierce passions made
the woman's breast pant. 'I hate her!' she
gasped between her clenched teeth&mdash;'I <i>hate</i> her!
I hate all thy black race, my lass. But ye shall
lick the dust, proud Mistress&mdash;I see it on yer
palm. Ye shall have the pale-faced sweetheart,
but it shall be across ruin and disgrace; an' by
settin' yer foot on the two dead bodies o' them ye
love like yer own soul, ye shall climb to yer
lad. Take him! I wish ye joy o' him <i>then</i>! I
care not, so long as I ha' vengeance, vengeance,
vengeance!' and the wild woman's eyes glared
with a fire like madness. She turned towards
Enderby, and shook her clenched fist that way. 'I
will have vengeance <i>then</i>, for all the dark hours
thou hast caused me, pretty daughter o' mine!
I will see thy boy dabbled in his blood; an' may
thy dead eyes be opened to see it too. Heaven's
malison light on thee!'</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ROYAL_NAVAL_RESERVE_AND" id="THE_ROYAL_NAVAL_RESERVE_AND">THE ROYAL NAVAL RESERVE AND
ROYAL NAVAL VOLUNTEERS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Whenever</span> England is engaged in a naval war or
any war including maritime operations on an
extensive scale, a difficult problem has to be solved&mdash;how
to man the ships? In the army, every
regiment has a sort of corporate existence; it never
dies&mdash;the exceptions, the actual disbandment of a
regiment, being very rare indeed. The number
of men varies according to the peace-footing or
the war-footing at which the regiment may stand
at any particular date; but at all times many
hundreds of trained men belong to it. Not so
in regard to a ship of war. When not wanted
for warlike, cruising, or other service, it is 'out
of commission;' all the officers and men are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">{567}</a></span>
paid off; and the ship, moored at Portsmouth
or some other naval station, is stripped of most
of its paraphernalia, ammunition, and stores, and
'laid up in ordinary,' with a few dockyard
or harbour men to take care of it. When
wanted again for active service, it has to be 'put
in commission' again; commissioned officers and
crew have alike to be engaged anew, just as
though the ship were fresh from the builder's
hands. Officers are always plentiful enough, the
number on half-pay in peace-time being very large&mdash;nearly
the whole of them desirous of engaging
in active service on full pay. With the sailors,
the A.B. (able-bodied) and common seamen, the
case is different; competition for their services
being kept up by the owners of large commercial
vessels.</p>

<p>The difficulty of suddenly obtaining a large
additional number of seamen was seriously felt
at the commencement of the Crimean war; but
the Admiralty solved the perplexity by organising
a <i>Royal Naval Reserve</i>, and obtained the
sanction of parliament for the necessary outlay.
The Reserve was to comprise men who, provided
they attend drill a certain number of days in each
year, may follow any avocation they please at
other times; it being a well-understood matter of
agreement that they shall be ready for active service
on the breaking out of war. Of course ship-owners
did not at first relish this scheme, seeing
that it established a new kind of competition
against them for hands; but in practice no particular
inconvenience has resulted. The men are
permitted to take their drill whenever it best suits
them; twenty-eight days per year all at one time,
or in periods of seven, fourteen, or twenty-one
days. Certain qualifications are insisted on before
enrolment, including a medical examination in
regard to health. The 'retainer' which the seaman
receives, and the prospect of pension, operate as inducements
to steadiness and against desertion; and
it is known that this is exercising a beneficial effect
on the mercantile marine, seeing that ship-owners
now give a preference to Royal Naval Reserve men
whenever they can get them. Mixing with the
regular men-of-war's men during the one month's
drill is also found to be beneficial; and some of
the Reserve go through all their exercises with as
much steadiness as a regular crew. The Admiralty
are empowered by parliament to engage thirty
thousand men in this way; the Reserve now comprises
twenty thousand; and it is believed that
there would be no great difficulty in making up
the full complement.</p>

<p>In a recently published Report by the Admiral
Superintendent of the body, the following remarks
occur: 'After all the expense the country has
been put to, and will have to bear prospectively,
for the organisation and maintenance of the Royal
Naval Reserve, will the men be forthcoming when
wanted? This can only be tested in the day of
trial, when the Queen's Proclamation will call the
Reserve out for active service; but I hold that we
have as reliable guarantees that the men will
present themselves, as under any system that could
be devised on the basis of voluntary service. The
men have entered on an engagement to serve, they
have received drill-pay and retainers under this
engagement, and without being branded by public
opinion, could not shrink from the fulfilment of
their duty. It would be doing an injustice to
the <i>élite</i> of the merchant service to suppose that
they are entirely devoid of patriotism, and would
not desire to serve in defence of their country.
Their prejudices against service in the royal navy
have been in a great measure removed; and they
would feel themselves competent from previous
training to work the guns and handle a rifle and
cutlass.'</p>

<p>Very little has yet been done to take the Reserve
on a cruise for rehearsal or practice. A merchant
seaman, to fit him for the Reserve, requires chiefly
to be made familiar with the great-gun exercise, to
handle the sword and rifle, to be steady and silent
under instruction, and to obey implicitly the orders
he receives. This training he will receive on board
the drill-ships especially set apart for the purpose,
or at batteries representing the section of a ship,
quite as well as in a man-of-war. The Reserve of
the first class (for the force is divided into classes)
have already been seamen in the merchant service,
and do not require instruction in seamanship.</p>

<p>The drill-ships and the practice-batteries are
distributed pretty well around the coasts of the
United Kingdom at about forty different stations&mdash;eight
in Scotland, seven in Ireland, and the rest in
England and Wales. There are nearly always
some men on drill at every ship and battery; but
it is noteworthy that in the fishing season in
certain parts of Scotland and in the Isles the drill
is pretty nearly in abeyance&mdash;herrings being more
important just then than big guns and cutlasses.
The first-class men are far more numerous than
the second, shewing that the main body are
already fairly good seamen before they enter the
Reserve. As to numbers in different places, the
drill-ships near busy ports are naturally more frequented
than those off a thinly populated coast.
The <i>President</i> in the Thames, the <i>Eagle</i> at Liverpool,
the <i>Unicorn</i> at Dundee, the <i>Netley</i> at Inverness,
the <i>Castor</i> at North Shields, the <i>Dædalus</i> at
Bristol, are among the drill-ships which receive the
greatest number of enrolled men for drill during
the year. Liverpool takes the lead in the number
of outsiders (seven-eighths of whom, however, are
already merchant seamen) who apply for enrolment.
Half the whole number in the force are
under thirty years of age, young men with plenty
of health and strength in them. Rather less than
half are at home or in the coasting-trade; rather
more than half voyaging in foreign seas, mostly,
however, on short voyages that will end within a
month. More of these voyages are to the Baltic
and the North Sea than to any other waters; the
next in numbers are those to the Mediterranean
and the Black Sea.</p>

<p>The officers who command or control the body
comprise lieutenants, sub-lieutenants, engineers,
assistant-engineers, and midshipmen. The lieutenants
must have served as sub-lieutenants one
year or upwards; most of them have been duly
qualified masters of merchant-ships. Midshipmen
are promoted to the rank of sub-lieutenant on
the fulfilment of prescribed conditions as to efficiency,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The men of the first-class now receive a grant of
a suit of clothing on enrolment and re-enrolment&mdash;an
arrangement which they much relish, as an
improvement on the plan at first adopted, when
each man was left to dress pretty much at random,
provided he looked something like a sailor. Nearly
all the A.B.s in the mercantile marine have joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">{568}</a></span>
or offered to join the body; thus affording proof
that it is popular. The second-class Reserve are
mostly fishermen, who are unacquainted with
square-rigged vessels, and are unaccustomed to
long absence from their homes; but they are fitted
for coast-defence service. In Scotland and especially
in the Shetlands, the second-class serves as
a stepping-stone to the first. Their pay is less
than that of the first-class, and they have no claim
for pension; therefore they have an inducement to
try for promotion. The authorities have had under
consideration the question whether to establish a
third-class, to consist of boys belonging to the
mercantile training-ships; but no decision appears
at present to have been arrived at.</p>

<p>In a discussion which took place at the Royal
United Service Institution some time back, it was
generally admitted that our band of hardy fishermen
might be made to form an excellent Naval
Reserve irrespective of regular seamen of the mercantile
marine. 'There are,' it was urged, 'one
hundred and fifty thousand men and fifteen thousand
boys employed in the fisheries of the United
Kingdom; besides the large number in the Canadian
Dominion and Newfoundland. It would not
be difficult to raise from among our large population
of <i>bonâ fide</i> fishermen a Reserve equal to the
full standard originally recommended. The drill
could be taught in the most efficient manner and
with the least expense to the government by
sending a gunboat to visit the fishing-boats at the
slack season. The local knowledge possessed by
the fishermen would be of immense value in coast-defence;
and there is an advantage in their having
fixed places of residence and never sailing under
a foreign flag; added to which is the value of their
physical strength, hardy and domesticated habits,
and good character.'</p>

<p>And now a few words for the <i>Royal Naval Artillery
Volunteers</i>, another body intended for defensive
purposes in the event of war. There is a
corps known as the <i>Coast Guard</i>, to fulfil service
on the coast in case of invasion; and under the
same kind of control are the <i>Royal Naval Coast
Volunteers</i>. These two bodies together comprise
nearly twenty thousand men, all good seamen, and
receiving liberal pay. But there is something
more peculiar about the <i>Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers</i>
likely to interest general readers. They are
virtually an offshoot or supplement of the Volunteer
Rifles, intended solely for defence against
invaders. Who the invader is to be we do not
know; haply and happily we may never know;
but a thought on the subject now and then is
reasonable enough. Our coast-line is very extensive,
and needs watching at a considerable number
of unprotected spots. Besides regular troops,
Volunteer infantry, and cruising war-ships, it has
long been felt that a naval artillery corps would be
a useful addition for serving in gunboats and mortar
rafts, and operating in the new art of torpedo-defensive
warfare. A small Marine Volunteer
Corps was raised at Hastings about 1863; others
were afterwards raised in London, Liverpool, and
Bristol; and at length, in 1873, parliament passed
an Act sanctioning the formation of a body to be
known as the <i>Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers</i>. So
far from being men who are paid for their services,
these Volunteers have to provide their own uniform
and to pay a small subscription to a corps
fund; they really enter into the matter <i>con amore</i>,
giving time, exertion, and some money for a purpose
which may eventually be valuable to our
common country. The government provide ships,
great guns, rifles, pistols, cutlasses, and other gear
for practice. Whether artisans, yachtsmen, or
rowing-men would join the corps in any considerable
number, could only be known by awaiting
the result; but it turns out that clerks&mdash;mostly in
commercial firms&mdash;come forward more readily than
any other class. They like the bodily exercise and
the open air after many hours of desk-plodding.</p>

<p>The idea is to render these Volunteers handy in
the defence of rivers and estuaries, by the management
of floating-batteries, armed rafts, and torpedoes.
In practising with big guns at such
places as London, Liverpool, and Bristol, there are
of course neither real shot nor blank cartridges
actually propelled from the weapon; a flash and a
slight report are all; to run out, point, fire, and
re-adjust are the exercises practised; and this is no
small work with a sixty-pounder gun. After this
big-gun drill, the Volunteers go through their rifle,
cutlass, and pistol drill; and the young men are
all the better for two or three hours of muscular
exercise and ocular training. They wear a useful
blue-and-white uniform while thus engaged. The
<i>Rainbow</i> gunboat in the Thames off Somerset
House, the <i>President</i> in the West India Docks, and
two similar vessels at Liverpool and Bristol, are
set apart by the Admiralty as drill-ships for the
purpose. The total strength is somewhat under
seven hundred men, with a naval instructor, petty-officer
instructors, lieutenants, sub-lieutenants,
shipkeepers, armourers, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Even if never really wanted for river and estuary
defence, these energetic young men will have no
reason, bodily or mental, to regret the step they
have taken&mdash;the devotion of a couple of hours
occasionally after office or warehouse time to a
right good exercise of muscle, nerve, brain, eyesight,
attention, and intelligence. It is a national
comfort to know that rifle and artillery volunteering
are alike free from many of the evils of young
men's recreations; they do not tempt to drinking,
to betting, nor to dissolute companionship. All
honour to those who promoted, and to those who
carry out the movement.</p>

<h2><a name="TIM_HARGATONS_COURTSHIP" id="TIM_HARGATONS_COURTSHIP">TIM HARGATON'S COURTSHIP.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">He</span> was mother's factotum, big Tim Hargaton. I
do not know how she could have managed the
farm without his clear head and sound judgment
to guide her. He had the name of being the
closest hand at a bargain and the best judge of a
'baste' in Innishowen; and I think he deserved
it; for mother very rarely lost upon her speculations
in cattle, and our animals were famed for
their beauty. Tim was not wholly an Innishowen
man. By his mother's side he claimed descent
from the Scottish settlers of the opposite coast,
and much of his cautiousness and shrewdness could
be traced to this infusion of kindly Scottish
blood. We children had rather an awe of Tim.
He ruled the outer world of our homestead with
a rod of iron. Woe betide the delinquent who
ventured into the garden before the 'house' had
been supplied with fruit for preserving! Woe be
to us if with profane hands we assaulted his
beloved grapes or ravaged his trim flower-beds!
I daresay it was very good for us that some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">{569}</a></span>
was set in authority over the garden and farm-yard,
for we were allowed quite enough freedom
indoors, fatherless tomboys that we were. But
years passed by; one by one we grew to womanhood.
I, the eldest, left home first&mdash;to return first;
more alone for having been so happy, too happy
for a little while. When I returned, a widow, the
younger birds had flown from the nest. Mother
had no one left but me, and she was growing old;
so I cast in my own and my boy's lot with her,
and soon became thoroughly acquainted with Tim
Hargaton. To him I was 'the young mistress' or
'Miss Ellen;' and I own I felt often at a disadvantage
with him. His quiet knowledge of subjects
I was utterly ignorant of, his cool rejection of
my farming theories, his almost certain success
in all his ventures, overawed me; and after a
struggle or two I gave in.</p>

<p>I think Tim must have been about forty at this
time; but he looked many years younger, being
fair and tall and well made, and&mdash;a bachelor.
He had a merry twinkle in his gray eyes which
almost contradicted the firm-set mouth with its
long upper lip and square massive chin; from his
half-Scotch mother he derived a close calculating
disposition, hard to convince, slow to receive new
impressions, strong to retain them when once
received. From his father roving Pat Hargaton
from Donegal, he drew an Irishman's ready wit
and nimble tongue, and under all an Irishman's
fickle heart, but not his warm affections,
which go so far towards amending the latter fault.</p>

<p>Another unusual thing amongst men of his class,
he was well to do, and having successfully speculated
in cattle on his own account, he had money
in the bank and a snug cottage. Yet year after
year, Shrove-tide after Shrove-tide&mdash;the marrying
season all over Roman Catholic Ireland&mdash;found
Tim rejoicing in single-blessedness; nor could
he have had a comfortable home, for his old
mother was a confirmed invalid; and as Tim
was reported to be 'a trifle near,' he only
afforded her the services of a little girl scarcely
in her teens. More than once mother spoke
to him about matrimony, and as often Tim met
her with the unanswerable argument: 'Is it as
easy to peck for two as for one, ma'am?' So she
ceased bothering him about it.</p>

<p>Now it befell that one bright frosty November
day I had despatched Tim to the county town on
very important business; and the better to assure
myself of the favourable issue of it, I walked to
meet him on his return. As the time of his
return was overdue, I began to feel rather uneasy,
and quickened my steps along the winding sea-side
road; but a turn in it soon revealed the
reason of Tim's delay. He was walking beside
a very pretty country lass; and another, not so
young or nearly so pretty, lagged a little behind.</p>

<p>'O ho, Master Tim!' I thought; 'are we to hear
news of you this Shrove-tide?'</p>

<p>As I came forward, the girls fell back, Tim
hastening on to meet me. He looked shy and
sheepish enough as he advanced; and the pretty
lass, whom I at once recognised as Mary Dogherty,
the acknowledged belle of the barony, hung her
shapely head in blushing confusion as she passed
me by.</p>

<p>Tim was all business and stolidity once the girls
were out of sight. He had lodged money for me
in the county bank; settled my own and mother's
accounts with butcher, baker, and grocer; transacted
all our various businesses with care and correctness;
and having given up his accounts into my
hands, he hurried on, whilst I continued my walk.
Twilight was falling when I returned home; but
although more than an hour had elapsed since
Tim had preceded me on the road, he was just
entering the gate as I turned from the sea-road
for the same purpose. I made mother smile that
evening when I told her of my encounter.</p>

<p>'But,' she said, 'poor little Mary has no fortune.
Tim will look for one with any girl <i>he</i> marries.'</p>

<p>A few days afterwards Tim took me into his
confidence. We were making our winter arrangements
in the green-house, putting away summer
plants whose flowering days were done, and filling
up gaps in our shelves with bright chrysanthemums
and other winter-blooming plants. An
hour sufficed to weary mother at this work, so
Tim and I were left alone amongst the flowers.
For some time he worked away in silence, but I
could easily see he was longing to speak, and so I
determined to give him an opportunity; but he
forestalled me.</p>

<p>''Twas a fine day the day I was in Derry, Mrs
Grace,' he said, as he passed me carrying a huge
coronella from one end of the greenhouse to the
other.</p>

<p>'It was indeed, Tim. Had you many people on
board the steamer?' I replied.</p>

<p>'No, ma'am; not to say very many. Them
officer-gentlemen from the Fort.'</p>

<p>'Had you any of the people from about here?'
I asked.</p>

<p>'Hugh Dogherty and his sister, and Susie
Connor, ma'am.'</p>

<p>'Ah, you walked home with the girls. What
became of Hugh?'</p>

<p>'Troth, ma'am, he just got overtaken with a
drop of drink, and I thought 'twas but friendly to
see the girls home.'</p>

<p>'I am sorry to hear Hugh was so bad as that,
Tim.'</p>

<p>'Well, sorra much was on him, Miss Ellen, but
he was loath to quit Mrs Galagher's when we got
off the boat, so we just left him there.&mdash;Hem!
Miss Ellen, I'v a thought to change my life.'</p>

<p>'I am very glad to hear it, Tim.'</p>

<p>'Yes, miss' (Tim always forgot my matronly
title in confidential talk)&mdash;'yes, miss. 'Tis lonely
work growing old with nobody to take care of
you.'</p>

<p>'That is a selfish way of looking at things, Tim,'
I replied.</p>

<p>'Begorra, miss, what else would a man marry
for but to have himself took care of?'</p>

<p>'I suppose liking the girl he married would be
a kind of reason too,' I responded.</p>

<p>'O ay. I'd still like to have the one I'd
fancy, if she was handy.'</p>

<p>'And who are you thinking of?' I asked, as Tim
bent over a box of geranium cuttings. 'I hope
she is nice and good, and will be kind to your
poor mother, and a good manager?'</p>

<p>'Faith, I wouldn't take one that wasn't that,
Miss Ellen,' he replied, without raising his head.
'But it's hard to tell how these young ones'll turn
out.'</p>

<p>'She is young then?'</p>

<p>'Young enough, and settled enough,' he responded.
'There's <i>two</i> I'm thinkin' of.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">{570}</a></span></p>

<p>'Two!' I exclaimed. 'Why, that is not right of
you, Tim. You are surely old enough to know the
kind of wife would suit you best; and it is unfair
to the girls. They are relatives, if I guess right.
Those two young women you were walking with
on Saturday?'</p>

<p>'Just so,' replied Tim, utterly unabashed: 'Mary
Dogherty an' Susie Connor. Mary's the <i>purtiest</i>,'
he added in a half soliloquy.</p>

<p>'I have always heard she was as good as she
looked,' I said. 'She has been such a dutiful
daughter and good sister to those wild boys, she
cannot fail to make a good wife.'</p>

<p>'Maybe,' quoth Tim. 'But the Dogherties is
down in the world these times.'</p>

<p>'I know they are not very rich; but they are
comfortable.'</p>

<p>'They aren't begging, miss, axing your pardon;
but musha! it's little softness there's about the
house.'</p>

<p>'Well, suppose she has known what it is to
want, she will know better how to take care of
plenty, when she gets it.'</p>

<p>'Troth, I don't know. Maybe when she'd get
her two hands full she'd be throwin' away, for
them that's reared in poverty seldom knows how
to guide plenty when it comes.'</p>

<p>'Well, I have always heard Mary extolled for
being the prettiest and the best girl in Innishowen;
and I am sure you may think yourself a happy
man if you can get her for your wife,' I said rather
sharply.</p>

<p>'Sorra word a lie in that, Miss Ellen,' replied
Tim, as he placed the last young geranium in its
pot. 'She's a good girl, and as purty a one as
you'd see in a summer's day; but I'm thinkin'
I'll step up an' see them all before I <i>spake</i> to her.'</p>

<p>'Why, Tim, have things gone so far as that?'</p>

<p>'Well, I may say I have her courted up to the
axin, miss.'</p>

<p>'And the other, Tim?' I asked, intensely
amused.</p>

<p>'Troth, I don't know, but I have her on hands
too.'</p>

<p>'Now, is that fair to either?' I asked rather
indignantly.</p>

<p>'Begorra, I don't know. A man has to look
before him sharp.'</p>

<p>'And who is the other? Mary's cousin?'</p>

<p>'Yes, miss&mdash;long Tom Connor's daughter, from
Shruve. She's up with Mary since Holly-eve.
Hudie's lookin' after her.'</p>

<p>'She's no beauty, Tim.'</p>

<p>'No, miss; but she's settled. They do say she's
a trifle coarse in the temper; but she has the finest
two-year-old heifer ever I set my eyes on. A pure
beauty, Miss Ellen.'</p>

<p>'And what good would the cow be to you, Tim,
if you had a sour cross-grained wife at home?'</p>

<p>'Maybe she wouldn't be sour or cross when
she'd have a good house over her head an' plenty.
She's gettin old, Miss Ellen, and she sees the
young ones comin' on, an' her left. There'd be a
quare change in her if she had her own way.'</p>

<p>'You seem to think more of the cow than the
girl, Tim!' I retorted.</p>

<p>'Troth, it's the purtiest av the two. But miss,
I'm sayin', what would you advise me?'</p>

<p>'Marry the girl you like best, Tim; never mind
the cow. A young sweet-tempered girl like Mary,
who has been so good to her sickly father and
mother, so gentle and loving to those wild brothers,
cannot fail to make a good wife. You will never
be sorry, if you marry the girl you like best.'</p>

<p>'True for you, ma'am&mdash;true for you. She is a
good girl, an' I'm nigh-hand sure I like her beyant
any woman in the world; but Miss Ellen, I'd
wish she had the cow!'</p>

<p>Next day I left home, nor did I return until the
daffodils were glittering in the springing meadows
around our home, and the rooks cawing over their
fledglings in the woods behind our garden. Tim
was married. I had heard that from mother early
in the year; but upon which fair maid his choice
had fallen, I was still uncertain. It was late at
night when I returned from my travels, and
mother had far too much to talk of to tell me
the termination of Tim's courtship.</p>

<p>In the morning, I took my way into the garden,
the farm-yard, the fields lying close by; but Tim
was not to be seen; nor did I encounter him until
late in the afternoon, when I discovered him busily
trenching up some early cabbages in the back-garden.
He seemed rather shy of me; but I put
out my hand and greeted him kindly.</p>

<p>'You're welcome home, Mrs Grace, ma'am,' he
said, striking his spade into the fresh-turned earth,
and shaking the hand I gave him with more than
ordinary warmth. 'We were thinking very long
to have got you back.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, Tim. So I have to wish you joy.'</p>

<p>Tim looked sheepish, but speedily recovered
himself. 'Yes, ma'am, if joy it be.'</p>

<p>'Oh, there can be no doubt on that score, Tim.
I hope Mary is well?'</p>

<p>'Mary? Is it Mary Dogherty? Why, she's
spoke of with Lanty Maguire that owns the ferry.'</p>

<p>'Why, I thought you were going to marry
Mary, Tim?'</p>

<p>'Well, no, Miss Ellen, I did not. I b'lieve her
an' Lanty was cried Sunday was eight days.'</p>

<p>'And what made you change your mind, Tim?'</p>

<p>'Well, I just took Susie; for you see, Miss Ellen,
I judged a cow would make the differ betwixt
any two women in the world.'</p>

<p>So after all, the cow carried the day!</p>

</div><div>
<h2><a name="CLERKS" id="CLERKS">CLERKS.</a></h2>

<p class='ph3'>BY ONE OF THEM.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Anybody</span> who can write may be a clerk: that is
the general notion, which is far from correct.
Among other accomplishments, an accurate and
thorough knowledge of book-keeping is required,
and so is a knowledge of the style employed in
official and business letters. In numerous cases,
parents in selecting avocations for their sons are
induced, from perhaps laudable, but somewhat
false notions of 'gentility,' to make them clerks,
frequently with little regard to their aptitude
for such an occupation. They seem to forget
or to ignore the fact that there are other departments
of the commercial world where there
is room enough and to spare for more candidates,
and many branches of skilled labour where ready
and well remunerated occupation could be found.
The consequence is that among those now in the
service there are many who have mistaken their
avocations, numbers who would probably have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">{571}</a></span>
succeeded well in some other sphere, not a few
others more fit to wield a sledge-hammer or
handle a wheel-barrow, than to write a letter,
keep a ledger, or prepare a balance-sheet.</p>

<p>Of course, as is generally known, there are
grades in this as in other professions. As might
be expected, there are not only skilled and half-skilled
labourers, but an admixture of drones.
The variety of employment and responsibility
of clerks is almost endless; there is no common
level to which they are subject. Their position
is peculiarly one of trust. In many cases the
clerk has to control the expenditure of his employer's
money, which necessitates the possession
of certain habits and characteristics. It is not
only important that he should possess the requisite
competency for the performance of the duties
intrusted to him, but his employers should know
of what his peculiar individuality consists; for
clerks are to a large extent intrusted with the
important task of working out the general principles
on which the business of their employers
is transacted. The man who is naturally unsystematic
can hardly be expected to work by system
in his business; he who in personal and domestic
matters is extravagant, will not be very likely
to introduce habits of economy into his business
transactions. Genteel appearance, good hand-writing,
the ability to add up dexterously the
columns of a ledger, are not the only qualifications
needful in a really efficient clerk.</p>

<p>The object of account-keeping should be the
production of a picture which in every detail,
as well as in one general view, should at all
times shew what and how work has been done,
and with what result it has been performed.
Unfortunately it is sometimes the case that
clerks, especially youthful ones, do not seem to
possess an adequate idea of the great object in
view, and which they are intended to assist in
carrying out. In the matter of correspondence too
the ability of clerks is put to the test, and their
natural temperament often exhibited. The art of
correct letter-writing is not to be gained by the
perusal of 'a Complete Letter-writer' however
complete, but can only be acquired by study and
practice, combined with some natural aptitude.
Business-like and civilly worded letters are an
earnest of business-like transactions, and may be
taken as an index to the ruling principles which
guide the actions of the principals. In this way,
clerks are intrusted by their employers with an
important responsibility, in which there is need
of the exercise of tact, judgment, and sound
principles.</p>

<p>In no small measure does the treatment of employers
mould the general disposition of clerks;
and no more powerful incentive can be given to
the latter than that of knowing that they are in
full possession of their employer's confidence. But
before extending this confidence, and appealing to
the higher motives of his clerks, it is all-important
that the employer shall have selected men fitted
for the places they are to occupy. If an air of
suspicion prevails, occasional deceit on the part of
the suspected can scarcely be wondered at. It
is no less requisite that clerks should put confidence
in each other, but unfortunately the
existence of petty jealousies often stands in the
way. And this is one of the peculiar characteristics
of clerks. There often exists a feeling that
one encroaches on the domains of another, and
not without cause; for there are those who 'run
cunning,' if such an expression is admissible,
and those who obtain favour and promotion
by mere arrogance and effrontery. Then there
are the excessively plausible men, whose working
capital is well nigh restricted to the glibness
of their tongue. Moral and mental excellence
are as a consequence sometimes overridden,
though as a rule but temporarily, for sooner or
later the higher and more stalwart qualities
of the quiet-spoken but thorough-going man
must prevail. It must not be forgotten that
employers need to have a good knowledge of
human nature, to be proficient in the art of judging
character, and to possess considerable tact; for
unfortunately it sometimes happens that the more
confidence placed in a man the less is he worthy
of it.</p>

<p>There have been discussions innumerable as
to the hours of manual labour; and important
changes, some the result of legislation, have taken
place. The overtaxing of mental power is, however,
of graver import than the overtaxing of
physical strength. In a large number of instances,
clerks are in an easy position in this respect,
those especially in certain government departments,
banks, and some commercial houses. There
are too many cases, however, in which clerks are
grievously overworked. The case of many branches
of the railway service may be cited where clerks
are almost incessantly employed twelve or fourteen
hours a day. Long hours are prevalent too
in connection with many commercial houses, in
which monotonous and unceasing labour during
unreasonable hours, is a great tax on the nervous
energies, and can only result in permanently weakening
the system of those engaged in it.</p>

<p>The number of hours occupied is not, however,
always a criterion to the amount of work performed.
Could such a standard have been taken
as a measure of tasks accomplished, the labour
question would not have been one so difficult to
deal with as it has come to be. It is sometimes
the case that long hours are associated with comparatively
little work. When time is not fully
occupied, there is a tendency to procrastination&mdash;work
is put off and put off, and then comes a
final scramble to get it done by the specified
time. In many instances, were shorter hours
adopted and the time fully occupied, the same
amount of work might be done, and done better;
it would not appear so irksome, punctuality and
method would be more easy of acquisition, and
thus employers and employed would be alike
benefited.</p>

<p>In point of salaries, the railway companies, and
some other large companies, adopt a uniform scale
applicable to junior clerks; but beyond this rule,
each individual case is dealt with according to its
merits, the rate of remuneration varying in proportion
to length of service, nature of work performed,
and responsibility entailed. Newspaper
advertisements occasionally convey an idea as to
the rate of remuneration in some instances. An
advertiser in <i>The Times</i> recently required the services
of a clerk in London, age nineteen to twenty-three,
salary commencing forty pounds. Another,
'Wanted a man as clerk; salary twenty shillings
weekly; must write a good hand, and be well up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">{572}</a></span>
arithmetic.' It would be interesting to know what
is here meant by a <i>man</i>? Three-and-fourpence a
day for a <i>man</i> as clerk in London, who possibly
might have a wife and what some call 'encumbrances!'
One would indeed be sorry to quote
this as a representative case; but it gives some
weight to the assertion that there are instances
too numerous of hard-working, underpaid clerks.
No wonder that there should be among this class
of men, so many pale and careworn faces, and coats
threadbare at the elbows with long service.</p>

<p>Since Dickens in his inimitable style first published
his tale of Scrooge and his unfortunate
clerk, many changes have taken place; but it is
to be feared that this character created in fiction
is still reflected in some realities. It is a law
of nature that everything flourishes in proportion
to the encouragement it receives; and in the same
way the actions and motives of servants are in a
considerable measure ruled by the disposition of
employers. Isolated cases there always will be
in which good treatment will be abused; and the
result of such circumstances naturally induces
some hesitancy to repose confidence in any; but as
a principle of general application, results must
depend upon the nature of the treatment adopted.</p>

<p>Clerk-labour would seem to be frequently
employed at the lowest possible price for which
it can be procured. But the same principle as
that employed by the manufacturer in paying a
good price for a machine that shall do its work
expeditiously and well, is equally applicable to
the purchasing of clerk-labour, in which much
discrimination and tact are necessary. Sometimes
those who are least competent and painstaking
are the most dissatisfied; some there are who
do not appear to understand degrees of merit, but
think that all should be reduced to something like
a dead level&mdash;that mere length of service, for
instance, should command the maximum of reward.
To length of service some reward is due, but the
tools should be put into the hands of those who
can use them, and who should of course be rewarded
accordingly. Mr T. Brassey, M.P., in a
speech on the labour question said: 'It is most
economical to pay labour well. It is better to
employ fewer men at high wages than more men
at low wages. Every individual is better off, and
the total expenditure on labour is reduced. For
the non-employed, fresh fields must be found, and
these will be opened by the ingenuity and enterprise
of mankind.'</p>

<p>The employment of females in certain departments
of clerk-labour would seem to be a thing
much to be desired and encouraged; and there is
ample scope for such employment where the
duties are light, straightforward, and not too onerous
in character. That the candidates are numerous
may be judged from the fact that some time
ago, in response to an advertisement for eleven
junior counter-women at metropolitan post-offices,
from one thousand to one thousand five hundred
young ladies presented themselves as applicants
at the offices of the Civil Service Commissioners
on one day! In cases where certain active business
qualifications are essential, it is not to be
desired, nor is it expected that females will in
any degree displace the other sex. The opposition
manifested by certain of the male sex to the opening
thus afforded for the extension of female labour
may fairly be characterised as somewhat unmanly.
But as we had occasion to say in an article on
'Female Occupations,' this extension of female
labour will by natural laws not proceed beyond
natural limits. The field for female work is circumscribed,
and an extension in such a direction
should be hailed with satisfaction. If the introduction
of female clerk-labour displaces some of
the overplus of boy clerks, and induces some to
adopt avocations more suited to their natural
fitness, much good will have been effected; for is
not the accomplishment of account-keeping and a
training in good business habits calculated to make
better wives and mothers? An intimate acquaintance
with simple account-keeping would be a valuable
addition to the education of many ladies of
the present day, and might save many a man's
income which, but for his wife's accomplishment,
would be unwittingly muddled away.</p>

<p>As a social animal, clerks possess some peculiar
characteristics. The banker's clerk cultivates
not the acquaintance of the lawyer's clerk; the
draper's clerk prefers not to associate with the
grocer's clerk. In the same establishment even,
the spirit of caste has often a prominent place:
those who by chance sit at a mahogany table
would seem to say by their demeanour that they
are far removed from those who occupy a deal
desk. 'At Birmingham,' says Samuel Smiles in
his <i>Thrift</i>, 'there was a club of workmen with
tails to their coats, and another without tails:
the one looked down upon the other.' What
a great thing it would be if, in society generally,
people would always have the courage to
appear what they are, rather than try to seem
what they are not! Some clerks if asked to
describe their avocation would disavow anything
so common as a clerkship; they would be 'an
accountant'&mdash;anything but a clerk. What will
not some folk do for the sake of keeping up
appearances? and amongst clerks this disposition
prevails to a considerable extent; as if appearance
to the world, and not the ruling principles of a
man's life, constituted the sole test of respectability.
Douglas Jerrold said: 'Respectability is all very
well for folks who can have it for ready-money; but
to be obliged to run into debt for it, it's enough to
break the heart of an angel.' Let those who are
anxious for sound and wholesome advice upon
this important subject read Mr Smiles' book above
quoted.</p>

<p>The social life of unmarried clerks is capable of
improvement, especially in large towns, into which
there is continually flowing a stream of young
men, who frequently have to be content with the
first apparently comfortable lodging that presents
itself, and to which nothing may be so foreign as
the most ordinary home comforts, in addition to
the accompanying risk of new associations formed
of a kind both unexpected and undesirable, often
likewise accompanied by impositions various and
numerous. It has been suggested that clerks' inns
or clubs should be established; and the idea is
well worthy the consideration of all those who
in any way are interested in the matter. The
advantages to be derived from undertakings of
this kind would be incalculable. Employers
of clerk-labour would be indirectly benefited,
and they would do well to assist in the promotion
of any movement in the direction indicated.
As regards clerks themselves, their comforts
might be considerably increased and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">{573}</a></span>
expenses lessened. Such establishments might
of course be made something more than mere
lodging-houses. Under proper management, they
might become a general resort both for amusement
and intellectual pastime. The constant social
intercourse of clerks with each other would tend
to engender good feeling, and by this association
an entirely new state of things would be brought
into existence. The exercise of some amount of
discipline would alone result in untold good, and
the fact of membership would constitute a permanent
recommendation as to respectability. As
regards expense, economy would be created by
co-operation; the quality of every article of food
might be insured. In fact, by this means might
be secured a maximum of happiness and comfort
for a minimum of expense.</p>

<p>A larger amount of judicious physical exercise
than is now practised would be of great benefit to
clerks. In the case of thousands in the large
towns, this is seldom resorted to beyond the mere
act of walking to and from business. In large
establishments, organisations for such recreation
might be more encouraged, and thus conduce to
the great desideratum, of a healthy mind in a
healthy body.</p>

<p>There is some doubt as to the future position
and prospects of clerks generally, but as we have
ventured to hint, little improvement can be anticipated
until supply and demand become more
equal. In many departments of skilled labour
there is ample scope for educated men; in fact
there is great need for them, and many a man now
in clerk-service would have met with far greater
success had he become an artisan. Indeed one
sometimes hears an expression of regret to the
effect that the task of wielding the pen, though it
be 'mightier than the sword,' had not given place
to the tools of a skilled workman. The fact of
receiving a salary and working short hours seems
to possess a considerable attraction to many, but
it would be well if this unsubstantial state of feeling
were removed. In many trades, such as book-binding,
there is often great difficulty in obtaining
a sufficient number of hands, especially 'hands
with heads,' the services of a tasteful 'finisher'
being highly paid.</p>

<p>Without in any degree depreciating the importance
of and necessity for efficient clerk-labour, it
would seem, taking a broad view of the question,
that the chances of success in life of educated and
persevering mechanics are fully equal to the prospects
of the majority of clerks. In many cases the
comparison is in favour of the artisan. The man
with a trade possesses a sort of independence, and
opportunities are frequent for his becoming his
own master.</p>

<p>The Council of the Society of Arts has taken an
important step in the matter of education. It has
been arranged for examinations to take place,
particularly for young men; certificates are to be
given to those who are successful, and this will
act as a passport to commercial employment. The
subjects of examination are as follows: Arithmetic,
English (composition, correspondence, and
précis writing), book-keeping, commercial history,
and geography, short-hand, political economy,
French, German, Italian, Spanish. To entitle a
candidate to this 'certificate in commercial knowledge,'
he must pass in three subjects, two of
which must be arithmetic and English. Every
encouragement should be given to such a movement,
calculated as it is to raise the general
standard of efficiency of clerks in the future; and
to those now in the service such a scheme is
calculated to convey some benefit.</p>

<h2><a name="A_LADYS_JOURNEY_IN_MOLDAVIA" id="A_LADYS_JOURNEY_IN_MOLDAVIA">A LADY'S JOURNEY IN MOLDAVIA.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> going to describe a journey I made across
Moldavia in 1863. Determined to leave the dust
and malaria behind us for a time, we set out from
Galatz one beautiful morning in the summer of the
year 1863, in search of the cooler air which blows
on the western side of the Carpathians. A village of
the Siebenbürgen, near the old town of Kronstadt,
was our destination. Early in the morning we
prepared to start&mdash;two ladies, two nurses, and
four children; all resigned to the absolute control
and guidance of Herr F&mdash;&mdash;, our dragoman and
courier; a little round bustling man, speaking
every European language with the ease of a not
particularly refined native; literally splendid in
theory and fertility of resource while any plan
was under discussion, though hardly equal to himself
in a practical emergency.</p>

<p>It was already dark when we arrived at the
town of Tekoutch. After a good deal of waiting
and difficulty, the Herr succeeded in procuring
for us the shelter of two flea-haunted chambers
at the top of a steep ladder. Whether this place
was the principal hotel of Tekoutch or only one
of the Herr's failures, I cannot say. All four
children were sleepy, hungry, hot, and unhappy.
Oh! for milk to make a refreshing drink for the
poor sick baby, who was wailing so piteously! Our
repeated calls brought upon the scene a hag&mdash;a
hag who would have been invaluable in melodrama,
but whose presence in the actual state of
affairs superadded active terror to the passive
discomfort of the children. Her upper-country
Moldavian was hardly intelligible, and she quite
refused to understand our modes of expressing ourselves.
But constant reiteration of the substantive
'Milk,' in every language and dialect known to us,
was at last so far successful that we procured a
small quantity of a curious gray fluid mixed with
fine sand, which the poor little ones were too sleepy
to judge critically; and we had soon the satisfaction
of seeing them asleep on the divans with their
nurses beside them. Before daybreak we were
all awake, and renewing the struggle with the hag
for the necessary provision of milk, to which she
was good enough to add a few cups of black coffee.
We removed such traces of yesterday's dust as we
could, by dipping the corners of our towels in
glasses of water. The Roumanian peasant's idea
of washing is so different from ours that it is
almost impossible to make them understand one's
requirements in that respect. A jar of water, a
friend to hold the jar, and standing-room in the
open air, are his requisites. He stands bent well
forward, to avoid the splashes, while the friend
pours a little water&mdash;a very little&mdash;into his hollowed
hands. These he rubs together, then holds
them out for a second supply, with which he
moistens the region immediately round his nose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">{574}</a></span>
The whole process requires a certain amount of
skill and dexterity, to which the results are hardly
commensurate.</p>

<p>Before five <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> we were on the road again. Our
way lay through a very pleasant region, and we
suffered much less from heat and dust than the
day before. The country was undulating and less
uniform. The roads were real roads, not mere
tracks through the fields, or across the steppe. The
wheat and barley were luxuriant all round; and
great fields of mustard in full bloom made patches
of a yellow, perfectly dazzling in its brightness.
As we approached the higher country we came on
large tracts of grazing-land soft and rich: trees
were scattered about&mdash;oak, hornbeam, lime, and
wild cherry, with an occasional birch or pine.
Thorn and rose bushes, tall as trees, shook showers
of blossom around. There were groups of feathery
tamarisk, clusters of Guelder-rose, and bowers of
white clematis thrown from shrub to shrub.
The roadside was a garden of wild-flowers; tall
spikes bearing alternate rings of deep purple
leaves and the brightest of yellow blossoms, blue
chichory, rose-coloured pea-blossom, sweet-williams,
and aromatic herbs that filled the air with their
perfume. A Roumanian cottage is generally a
pleasant resting-place in the heat of summer; the
roof of reed-thatch, or oak-shingle, projects so far
as to shade the whole cottage, and within are
whitewashed walls, and cushioned divans covered
with rugs of thick home-made cloth, woven in
brightly coloured stripes.</p>

<p>In the little inn at Domnul where we next
arrived we laid down the children to take siesta;
and by four next morning we were astir again and
eager to set out, as we knew that a few hours'
driving would bring us to the Oïtos Pass, of the
beauties of which we had heard so much. By
half-past five we were off. The country got more
lovely at every step. Low wooded hills rose in
front; the glens, between, highly cultivated, though
uneven and rugged in places. The road was terraced
along the side of an abrupt slope: the driver
of the baggage wagon managed to get a wheel on
the bank, and over went the wagon, boxes and
bundles rolling pell-mell down the hill. An
hour's work, not without much vocal accompaniment,
put all to rights, and our caravan
was again in motion. Many brooks made their
way down from the hills, and we had to cross
numerous wooden bridges, for the most part in
a very sad state of repair. Here a plank was
missing, and a hole yawning under the horses'
feet, shewed the foaming water beneath; there
another rose and tilted up as the horses trod on
the end. But the steady little animals never
flinched; they picked their footing as mules would
have done, and so we passed in safety. At noon
our rest only lasted half an hour, and soon after
starting we came to the Roumanian guard-house
at the entrance of the pass. We were joined at
this point by two Austrian soldiers, who accompanied
us on horseback through the pass, bringing
up the rear of our procession.</p>

<p>On all sides of us the steep, richly wooded hills
rose abruptly; higher mountains shewing their
snowy caps at intervals as the gorge opened up
the distant view. Here, there, and everywhere
roared and brawled the little river; now narrow
as a winding thread, deep, below the road, which
crossed and recrossed it by means of bridges, the
safe passing of which seemed each time a fresh
miracle; now widening in gleaming shallows, as
from time to time the glen spread itself out to
hold a little village. Each separate patch of gray
rock contained its homestead; white cottages, with
dark, quaintly carved, and pinnacled shingle-roofs,
overshadowed by orchard trees or festooned with
trailing vines. The population seemed to live in
the water; men were fishing in the pools, women
beating the linen on the flat rocks, or spreading the
webs to bleach in the sunshine; while the children
waded about in their one short garment, or bathed,
diving plunging and chasing each other like veritable
troops of 'water-babies.' What a handsome
race they were, those Roumans of the Carpathians!
Those we met on the road passed us with a
courteous greeting, and went on their way; the
women in their long white garments, drawn in
at the waist by a broad brass-studded leather
belt; the many coloured fringe, which fell straight,
almost to their ankles, opening here and there as
they walked to shew glimpses of the white below.
Their feet were bare or covered by moccasins of
undressed leather. Over their coils of plaited hair
lay a square of embroidered linen, from one corner
of which a coin hung over the forehead, and more
coins formed earrings and rows of necklaces. The
men wore a great loose white blouse, a studded
belt, broader and heavier than those of the women,
in which were stuck knives, daggers, and heavy
pistols. On their feet were either moccasins or
boots high above the knee. Their long uncut
hair hung over their shoulders; and, twisted round
their broad hats were ribbons of the national
colours&mdash;red, blue, and yellow.</p>

<p>The ascent at first was gradual, but our horses
being tired, we all walked for several hours.
The soft rich beauty of the glen increased at each
moment; hill rose above hill, covered with the
mellow green of the young fir shoots, each tree
bearing the golden red crown of last year's cones.
The hanging birches with their silver stems swept
over slopes smooth as a lawn, save where here and
there the bold gray rock cropped out. Little glens
ran up the mountain sides, scented with wild
thyme, which overpowered even the fragrance of
birch and fir. An hour before sunset we reached
a large village the name of which I have forgotten.
Here were more guard-houses, and difficulties
about examining our baggage. As we were anxious
to avoid this scrutiny, we administered a gratuity
to the guards, who speedily became our friends;
but as we were preparing to resume our journey
an unfortunate difficulty arose.</p>

<p>The Herr announced to us after half an
hour's search, that no horses were to be procured.
'Then we had better remain here for the night,'
we decided at once. But no. The Herr had
undertaken us, and he alone must have an
opinion. We felt that he knew the country, and
that we did not, and gave way, though unwillingly,
on his assurance that less than twenty minutes
would bring us to the Austrian frontier, where we
would be sure to find fresh horses. So we reluctantly
reseated ourselves. The horses had been
at work since early morning, and were utterly
exhausted, crawling at a foot's pace. The shades
were gathering deeper and deeper around us; the
ground rose much more rapidly than before; the
road in some places was so bad as to be almost
impassable; worst opposite a tablet let into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">{575}</a></span>
rock, which informed the grateful traveller, in
letters of gold and in choice Latin, how Prince
Alexander Ghyka had made and finished it in
1855. The Herr's twenty minutes had lengthened
to an hour or more when we reached a narrow
treeless gorge, the heights crowned on either side
by half-ruined fortress towers, while grim loop-holed
modern walls ran down to meet in an
immense gateway, whose shut doors barred our
path. To the left, a small plateau of green turf
bordered the crag overhanging the stream, which
now held its rapid course many feet below us.</p>

<p>Our arrival was an event. The guardian of the
pass was fat, fussy, and important, and quite deaf
to any representations of our anxiety to proceed.
Had we anything to declare? No; certainly not.
No tea? No. Nor tobacco? No. But then it
struck him that there must be some tobacco for
present use among our drivers; so a strict personal
search was made; the tobacco-pouches were
emptied, and their contents thrown over the crag.
We were injudicious enough to remonstrate, as we
would willingly have paid something to allow the
poor men to keep their tobacco; and this seemed
to determine our <i>douanier</i> to display his authority
to the full, for soon the sward was strewn
with our possessions, which included bedding,
provisions, and books, as well as the clothing of
the whole party. The men must have had a dull
time of it in this lonely mountain fort, to judge
from their excitement at the display of our goods.
At last we seized a packet of tapioca and implored
the great man to pass it and the nurses and
children, that they might find rest and refreshment
beyond the gates. To this, after a very critical
scrutiny, he consented; and we despatched them
to look for a krishma beyond the boundary.</p>

<p>When we had satisfied the douanier and seen
such order as was possible restored to our luggage,
we followed, and found them installed in
a miserably dirty little place, where the children
of the family, who were crowding round,
looked so evidently ill, that, fearing something
infectious, we were constrained to hurry the preparation
of the tapioca, and go out again to the
open air. At last the Herr appeared, and had to
confess his failure. We ought to have passed the
night at the village we had left two hours before;
to pass it here was impossible.</p>

<p>'We must feed the horses and push on,' said the
Herr; 'it is not an hour's drive.'</p>

<p>Alas! we were beginning to understand but too
well what the Herr's 'hours' were like. But the
night was mild and pleasant, though already dark;
and having arranged beds for the children among
the cushions, we continued our journey with a
briskness on the part of both drivers and horses
which was wonderful after the hard day's work
they had gone through. There was just light
enough from the stars to shew us the dangerous
nature of the road, which rose in rapid zigzags.
There was no parapet, and the little river ran
below at a depth which increased at every turn.
The heavy travelling-carriage seemed to drag back
the horses, and the drivers of the wagons had to stop
and push it up. At last we reached the top; but
it was two o'clock before we reached Bereck. All
the inhabitants were asleep; but the people of the
krishma, after we had roused them, received us
very hospitably, and busied themselves in attending
to our comforts. It was late next morning
when we resumed our journey, and we were now
able to perceive that the scene had a beauty of its
own&mdash;that of vast extent. Nowhere have I seen
a wider horizon, and yet hills closed it in all
round, but at a great distance. The plain over
which we were passing formed a vast amphitheatre,
and the eye took in at one sweep at least
a dozen villages, all widely apart from each other.
The roads were as excellent as, under Austrian
management, they always are. Good horses were
to be found at all the posting-houses; and by the
middle of the following day we had approached
the mountains which bounded the other side of
the plain, and found ourselves at our journey's
end.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CHANGES_OF_COLOUR_IN_THE" id="THE_CHANGES_OF_COLOUR_IN_THE">THE CHANGES OF COLOUR IN THE
CHAMELEON.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">From</span> very ancient times the curious changes of
colour which take place in the chameleon, and its
supposed power of living on air, have been the
wonder of the uninformed, and have furnished
philosophers and poets with abundant material for
metaphor. The belief that the animal can live on
air has been exploded long ago, and was no doubt
due to its power of long fasting and to its peculiar
manner of breathing. It is only quite lately, however,
that any satisfactory explanation has been
given of the apparently capricious changes which
take place in the colour of the chameleon;
the latest researches on the subject being those
of M. Paul Bert, the French naturalist, which
have been described in a recent paper by M.
E. Oustalet. As most of our readers are no
doubt familiar with the appearance and figure
of this curious reptile, and as descriptions of it
may be found in any encyclopædia or elementary
work on natural history, we do not consider it
necessary to repeat them here.</p>

<p>Many and various theories have been proposed
to explain the changes of colour which chameleons
undergo; changes the importance of which have
been greatly exaggerated. It is generally believed
that these animals have the power of assuming in
a few seconds the colour of any neighbouring
object, and that they intentionally make use of
this trick to escape more easily from the sight of
their enemies. But this opinion is erroneous; and
experiments conducted with the greatest care have
proved that chameleons are incapable of modifying
their external appearance in anything like so
rapid and complete a manner.</p>

<p>The first probably to give any rational account
of the causes of the puzzling changes of colour
in these reptiles was the celebrated French naturalist,
Milne-Edwards, about forty years ago.
After a patient and minute examination, he discovered
that the colouring matters of the skin,
the pigments, are not confined as in mammals
and birds, to the deep layer of the epidermis, but
are partly distributed on the surface of the dermis
or true skin, partly located more deeply, and stored
in a series of little cells or bags of very peculiar
formation. These colour-cells are capable of being
shifted in position. When they are brought close
to the surface of the outer skin, they cause a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">{576}</a></span>
definite hue or hues to become apparent; but by
depressing the cells and causing them to disappear,
the hues can be rendered paler, or may be altogether
dispersed. It is noteworthy that the cuttlefishes
change colour in a similar manner.</p>

<p>Underneath the colour-bags (or <i>chromoblasts</i> as
they are called) of Milne-Edwards, Pouchet, a
recent inquirer, has discovered a remarkable layer,
which he calls <i>cærulescent</i>, and which possesses the
singular property of appearing yellow on a clear,
and blue on an opaque background.</p>

<p>M. Paul Bert, within the last two years, has by
his researches thrown still further light upon
these curious changes, and upon the mechanism
by which they appear to be accomplished. He
endorses most of the results of Milne-Edwards and
subsequent inquirers, but has carried his observations
much further. It would be out of place
here to give a detailed account of the methods by
which M. Bert has arrived at his conclusions.
Suffice it to say, that by a series of careful experiments,
he has discovered that these changes of
colour seem to be entirely under the control of
the nervous system, and that the chameleon can
no more help them taking place than a toad can
help twitching its leg when pinched. By acting
in various ways upon the spinal marrow and the
brain, the operator can send the colour to or withdraw
it from any part of the body he pleases. Indeed
a previous observer was able to cause a change
of colour in a piece of the skin of the animal by
acting upon it with electricity; and M. Bert has
proved that even in the absence of the brain the
usual changes can be produced by exciting the
animal in any way; thus shewing that they are
due to that class of nervous action which physiologists
name <i>reflex</i>, and of which sneezing is a good
example. M. Bert has also made some interesting
experiments on the animal while under the influence
of anæsthetics and during sleep. It was
formerly known that in the latter case, and also
after death, the chameleon assumed a yellowish
colour, which under the influence of light became
more or less dark. M. Bert has found that exactly
the same effects are produced during anæsthesia
as during natural sleep, and that light influences
not only dead and sleeping chameleons, but that it
modifies in a very curious fashion the coloration
of the animal when wide awake. The same
result is produced when the light is transmitted
through glass of a deep blue colour, but ceases
completely when red or yellow glass is used. To
render these results more decisive, M. Bert contrived
to throw the light of a powerful lamp upon
a sleeping chameleon, taking care to keep in the
shade a part of the animal's back, by means of a
perforated screen. The result was curious: the
head, the neck, the legs, the abdomen, and the tail
became of a very dark green; while the back
appeared as if covered with a light brown saddle of
irregular outline, with two brown spots corresponding
to the holes in the screen. Again, by
placing another animal, quite awake, in full sunlight,
but with the fore-part of its body behind a
piece of red glass, and the hind-part underneath
blue glass, M. Bert divided the body into two quite
distinct parts&mdash;one of a clear green with a few
reddish spots, and the other of a dark green with
very prominent spots.</p>

<p>From his researches as a whole, M. Bert concludes:
1. The colours and the various tints
which chameleons assume are due to changes in
the position of the coloured corpuscles, which
sometimes, by sinking underneath the skin, form
an opaque background underneath the cærulescent
layer of Pouchet; sometimes, by spreading themselves
out in superficial ramifications, leave to the
skin its yellow colour, or make it appear green and
black. 2. The movements of these colour-bags or
chromoblasts are regulated by two groups of
nerves, one of which causes them to rise from
below to the surface, while the other produces the
opposite effect.</p>

<p>As to the effects produced by coloured glass,
they no doubt result from the fact that the
coloured corpuscles, like certain chemical substances,
are not equally influenced by all the rays
of the spectrum, the rays belonging to the violet
part having alone the power of causing the colour-bags
to move and drawing them close to the surface
of the skin. This exciting action of light on
a surface capable of contraction, an action which
hitherto has only been recognised in the case of
heat and electricity, is one of the most unexpected
and curious facts which in recent times have
transpired in the domain of physiology. Hence
M. Paul Bert's researches are likely to prove of far
more value than merely to explain the changes of
colour which take place in the chameleon. He
hopes especially in carrying out his researches to
discover the reason of the favourable influence on
health which is exerted by the direct action of
light on the skin of children and of persons of a
lymphatic temperament; and this may lead to
some very important practical results in the treatment
of disease. In the meantime he has done
much to clear up a very puzzling and very interesting
fact.</p>
